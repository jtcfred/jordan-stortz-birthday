# Jordan's Birthday Website

This year for my girlfriend's birthday, I made a website for all of her friends to use to show Jordan how much we appreciate her!

## Contents

This website includes a place to submit birthday wishes, a Jordan-centric quiz, and a Spotify playlist that is open for contribution

## Wish Submission

To add a wish, navigate to the wish submission page, and enter your wish information. Please be courteous and appropriate.

## Technology

For this project I used NextJS 13, Chakra UI, and MongoDB

## Roadmap

If I ever decided to polish this project, I will add answer checking to the quiz for immediate feedback and add a quiz score leaderboard.
